I'm a sophomore student from [SHIEN-MING WU SCHOOL OF INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/wusie_en/main.htm), [South China  University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). My research interest includes Multi agent system, motion planning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhongqiang Ren](https://rap-lab.github.io/) of RAP Lab from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
